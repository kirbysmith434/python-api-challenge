# python-api-challenge
Description
In the first part of this challenge, I was asked to analyze weather data that came from citipy Python library and OpenWeatherMapAPI. The code in the WeatherPy.ipynb analyzes weather from around the world, specifically looking at how the weather differs the closer and farther coordinates are from the Equator. For the second half of this challenge, I was tasked with utilizing the weather data and inferences made after viewing the data to plan a vacation by locating specific hotels based on a criteria related to the location's weather. The data used for the second part came from Geoapify API. The code within VacationPy.ipynb locates hotels in areas of the world within a 1000 meter radius that have my desired weather conditions. To accomplish this analysis, I utilized my Mac OS, Python Notebook, Pandas, Matplotlib, and GitHub.

Table of Contents
Code for analysis found in the 'WeatherPy.ipynb' file and 'VacationPy.ipynb' file within the 'python-api-challenge' directory. Data for WeatherPy analysis was pulled from the 'cities.csv' within the 'output_data' directory. Report about the analysis is contained in the "Report.txt' file.

Installation Instructions
Code utilized for this challenge can be found in the files titled "WeatherPy.ipynb" and "VacationPy.ipynb" within the WeatherPy directory on my github "python-api-challenge" repo.

Usage
Can Git Clone all files from my python-api-challenge repo.

Credits
For this challenge I utilized the ASK BCS feature on Slack, Google, ChatGPT, fellow students, YouTube, Stack Overflow, TA assistance, Bootcamp tutor assistance, and educational resources related to the unit provided by the bootcamp.

License
